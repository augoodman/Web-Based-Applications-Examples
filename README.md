#Lab 1
For this lab (in activity 2), I followed Dr. Mehlhause's example for the loading of modules.  If the test files for grading use the same naming convention, the following commands may be cut and paste into the terminal as they are.  Otherwise, use the the first two lines of each part and replace the third line with:
```
.load <respective_test_file_name_here>.js
```
My versions of the test files are included for reference.

##Activity 2 Part A Commands
```
node
.load lab1act2partA.js
.load lab1act2partA_test.js
```

##Activity 2 Part B Commands
```
node
.load lab1act2partB.js
.load lab1act2partB_test.js
```

##Activity 2 Part C Commands
```
node
.load lab1act2partC.js
.load lab1act2partC_test.js
```
